                <p> As a group of passionate parents, we decided to create Mad for Books to promote the enjoyment and
                    fulfillment of reading books with your children and the key skills it can give them in preperation
                    for further education.</p>

                <p> We welcome children of all reading abilities and our main priority is that your child simply enjoys
